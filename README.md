# Recurrent-Neural-Network-LSTM-GRU-based-Aircraft-Trajectory-Prediction

This program is a final year undergraduate program (FYP) and is currently in progress. This project uses the dataset from the Aircraft Localization Competition, but unlike the competition, I only use it for training neural network models. Here is some analysis of the dataset:

Trajectory of an aircraft:

The dataset is available for download on the competition website.
